# Thoughts

Inspirational, heady, changes gears a lot. Fun history lesson.

# Take-Aways

* Delight lies between boredom and confusion; entertaining patterns are consistent but difficult to grok
* Code has a social and historical context. The symbols it contains encode assumptions about the environment in which the code was considered useful. Eg. PRINT command from the original 1964 system ran on a teletype, 80 column limit comes from IBM punch cards.
* Wendy Chun warns against fetishizing code; celebrate practical solutions, not cryptic trivia
* C64 Basic does all math in floating point, only casting to int as a param

# Concepts

* "a fragment of substance" - Barthes
* "cultural analysis" - Manovich
* "culturomics" - Michel
* "distant reading" - Moretti
* "Perl pie" mnemonic - refers to the p,i,e flags used for immediate cli eval
* ; operator - suppresses newline after print
* ? operator - short form for PRINT
* @party - demoscene meet-up
* Aleatoire - French mathematical term for random
* Aleator - Latin for gambler
* Ariadne's Thread - traces a unicursal path through a maze; metaphor for following a prescribed solution
* CHR$ and ASC - from number to char and back
* Commodore - Canadian company, founded in Toronto, 1958, by Jack Tramiel, bought MOS Technology in 1976 for $750k, PET was the first PC that retailed for under $1k (1977)
* Commodore USA - necro-branded company released a C64 retro console
* Core Memory - 10 PRINT diagonals resemble physical core memory's binary states
* Critical Code Studies - critical theory applied to code, Marino
* Euclidean Grid - as a design space, Manhattan island, ENIAC tube banks, server farms, core memory; Grid Art movement of the 1960s and 1970s - Frank Stella, Ad Reinhardt, Carl Andre, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Agnes Martin, GRAV (Morellet, Le Parc), ZERO (Mack, Piene), Systems Group (Steele, Lowe)
* Gestalt - grouped units that create a more complex whole
* Knossos, Crete - famous ancient maze of myth, site of Theseus and the Minotaur
* Lab Rat Maze - first one built by Willard Small of Clark University to occupy idle rats that weren't being tested; it was modeled after the Hampton Court Palace maze
* Litema Patterns - from South Africa, geometric murals of the Sotho
* Maze Runners - warrior on a quest, penitent disciple undertaking a ritual, children at play, lab rats being tested
* People's Computer Compancy (PCC)  - Bob Albrecht, San Francisco, 1975, Menlo Park
* Port - Latin "portare": to carry or bear; trans + latus - translation; problem is deciding what is essential to the original (what must be reproduced); porting changes constraints and forces small changes that can dramatically alter the behaviour of a program, thereby exposing something about its original context and underlying nature
* Random - probably derives from randir (to run or gallop); connotes violence rather than fortune; modern notion of randomness is tied to science and statistics
* Traf-O-Data - early business venture of Paul Allen and Bill Gates, programmed on Washington State University mainframe simulator of the 8008 processor
* Typographical Markup - * indicates a footnote, / indicates a line break; code langs coopted them as operators
* Unicursal / Multicursal Maze - unicursal maze has no branches, is all along a path; some definitions of labyrinth specify that it is unicursal; tends to have a ritualistic role, not a puzzle; typing out a one-liner by rote is like a unicursal ritual; used in church courtyards as a metaphor for the path to salvation, Helmut Birkan cites the appearance of multicursal aberrations starting in the 15th century as a symptom of the secularization of the labyrinth
