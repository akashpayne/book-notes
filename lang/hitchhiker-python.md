* by Kenneth Reitz and Tanya Schlusser
* published by O'Reilly, 2016

# Thoughts

A whirlwind tour of intermediate level Python development. Lots of practical advice; unlikely to age well, but captures the spirit of the era.

# Take-Aways

* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea
* Deciding between [Python 2 or Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) can be difficult.
* [Python 3 changes](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit) a lot to do with networking, sockets, web, unicode support: "Everything you thought you knew about binary data and Unicode has changed."
* Dictionary `get` method can take a default value to return
* `string.format()` params use curly braces in the format str, can be positional or named
* Prefer to join lines by enclosing them in parenthesis rather than using a backslash
* A failing test can be used to document what you wanted to accomplish next
* Best practice for projects to include README, LICENSE, INSTALL, TODO, and CHANGELOG
* Respect system configuration, eg. check proxy servers with `urllib.requests.getproxies()`, use standard POSIX and [Linux environment variables](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables)
* Logging practices: add the NullHandler to project's logger to suppress warnings; do not add other handlers if you project is used as a library, since it should be up to the user what the log behaviour is; Twelve-Factor App defines some best practices for logging; logging configuration can be loaded from an INI file or set as a dictionary
* Very readable Python projects: HowDoI, Diamond, Tablib, Requests, Werkzeug, Flask
* Pythonic to use try/except to infer type

# Gotchas

* Beware using `in` operator on lists; unlike sets and dicts (hash tables), it will do a time consuming sequential search
* Immutable strings have the same performance concern as C#; rather than appending in a loop, build a list and joining as a final step
* US users cannot legally use your code if no license is provided
* Do not change the symbolic link to the Python executable; you will create a mismatch between the exe and the libs
* Virtual environments contain hardcoded paths in executables, cannot move them once created
* Test `tearDown` does not run if the test failed
* Python 2 classes don't always inherit from `Object`
* `@classmethod` is decorative and does not restrict access; We Are All Responsible Users

# Concepts

* `*` operator - creates N references to the same value (reference semantics)
* `@classmethod` - class method decorator; causes the first argument to be a reference to the class rather than self
* `@property` - class method decorator; works in conjuction with `__get__()`, `__set__()`, and `__delete__()`
* `__` - used to ignore a result; `_` is used as an alias for `gettext.gettext()`, also value of the last op on the cli
* `__init__.py` - if this exists in a directory, it is considered a Python package; top level is the root package; common practice to have an empty `__init__.py` for a root package when the subpackages do not share code
* `__slots__` - class optimization; avoids allocating a dictionary for each object; useful when very small objects are allocated many times; Tablib has a good example of using this with serialization
* `in` operator - prefer `in` to dictionary `has_key` method
* `pickle.dump()` - used in object serialization, depends on `__dict__` or `__getstate__()`
* `re.VERBOSE` option - allows well-documented regex strings
* `sets` - supports set arithmetic; difference `-`, union `|`, and intersection `&` operators
* `text_type()` - convert strings to unicode, both Py 2 and Py 3 compatible
* Active Record ORM - objects represent record data and also abstract operations on the underlying db
* Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) - comm protocol, used by RabbitMQ
* Application Binary Interface (ABI) - a CFFI feature that allows calling into code that is in a binary shared library (DLL or so file)
* Arbitrary Keyword Argument Dictionary - aka `**kwargs`, but try to use a more sensible name
* Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) - introduced by Dan North in 2003
* Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) - Guido van Rossum
* Bigram - pair of consecutive words
* C Fast Function Interface - probably a mistaken reference to CFFI
* C Foreign Function Interface (CFFI) - extend Python with C funcs, often used for optz
* Continuous Integration - Martin Fowler describes it best
* coroutines - `async def` syntax, part of async io
* CSSSelect - W3C standard to specify a path through an html document
* Data Mapper ORM - has separate interfaces to present db records and to operate on the underlying data; a mapper function converts between data objects and db records
* Data Model - from the Python docs: namespace tools, dir(), globals(), locals()
* Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) - makes implementing db drivers easier
* Diagnostic vs Audit Logging - business events should be logged for audit purposes, not just debugging
* Django Girls - charity organization, provides training
* doctest - introduced in Python 2.1, typically less detailed than unit tests but provide a nice combination of test and doc
* Executable Zip File - if zip contains `__main__.py` then Python interpreter will run it; can even prepend a she-bang `#!` to make a Unix executable file
* External Data Representation (XDR) - Sun serialization format, Python lib is xdrlib; both sender and receiver must know the data format in advance
* extra-index-url - cli param for pip, can specify an internally hosted package repo; use the dir structure MyPackageName/MyPackageName.tar.gz
* Form-Encoding - used for POST data
* Freezing Code - bundle packages for distribution; difficult when not all dependency licenses allow for bundled redistribution
* Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) - method used by CPython for thread-safety; oft-cited performance bottleneck; many networking libs use async methods to work around this
* IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force, RFCs 7230 through 7235 define http specs
* Immutable Types - data cannot change; strings, numbers, and tuples are immutable
* Internet of Connected Products (IoCP)
* JSON - JavaScript Object Notation; Python 2.6 added the json lib but PyPI also provides simplejson
* Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication (HMAC) - RFC 2104
* Keyword Arguments - optional args with default values
* Late Binding Closures - var values are looked up at the time of the inner function call; lambda expressions work the same way as def functions
* Linux Built Distribution - "correct" way to distribute a frozen Python app on Linux; does not include the interpreter, saves \~2MB
* List Comprehension - `[value for __ in range(N)]` creates N copies (value semantics)
* Mersenne Twister - pseudorandom number generator used by random lib
* Metaclass - defines how a class behaves; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-are-metaclasses-in-python/6581949
* Monkey Patch - change a method at runtime
* Mutable Default Arguments - modifying the value of an argument changes the default value for subsequent calls; default values use reference semantics, handy for implementing a cache
* Mutable Types - data can be modified in-place; cannot be dictionary keys; lists are mutable
* NoSQL - prefer to call it "not only SQL"
* Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) - provides data types backed by a db schema
* Open Source Initiative (OSF) - provides some popular licenses
* Password Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) - recommended in NIST Special Publication 800-132
* Percent-Style Formatting - the old hat string formatting style

* Python Software Foundation (PSF) - provides their own software license for contributors
* Python Software Foundation License (PSFL) - compatible with GNU license
* Pythonista - veteran python developer
* Ravioli Code - many similar little pieces of logic without good structure; one symptom is that it is hard to remember what types are used for what purpose * because many similarly named, closely related types exist
* RESTful API - employs Representational State Transfer and HTTP verbs (Get, Put, Post, Delete, etc.), influenced HTTP 1.1 but is not a standard
* RTMF - Read the Manual, Friend!
* Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) - should do multiple iterations on this when hashing passwords
* Shims Directory - used by pyenv
* site-packages directory - where user installed packages are kept
* Socket - the combo of an IP address with a port, a transport protocol, and an i/o channel (file-like object); see https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html
* Source Code Management (SCM) - frumpy term for revision control
* Structured Query Language (SQL) - an ISO standard, but heavily vendor specific in practice
* TCP/IP - divided into layers: link (hardware, OS), internet (IPv4, IPv6), transport (TCP, UDP), application (HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
* TLDRLegal - web site that summarizes popular open source licenses
* Tox - Python cli test environment, look for `tox.ini` config in projects
* Underscore Prefix - variables can only be private by convention, using underscore prefix is encouraged

Creating Packages

```
$ echo '#!/usr/bin/env python' > my_bin
$ cat my_py.zip >> my_bin
$ chmod u+x my_bin
```
```
$ pip freeze | xargs pip install --target = packages
$ touch packages/__init__.py
# requires using "import packages.foo as foo" for all dependencies
```
