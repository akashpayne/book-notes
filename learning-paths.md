## DIY Computing Science Degree

My attempt at a general computing science curriculum. Some introductory books followed by a progression of low level to high level programming (machine code -> C -> Lisp -> Java) with material about compilers, operating systems, networks, databases, and design patterns along the way.

A real Comp Sci curriculum would be a lot more math-y, with calculus, linear algebra, and statistics material at a bare minimum. It'd be great to start a separate list for that.

There's a lot of room for improvement and refinement. I need to actually work through this list in order to vet it. I'd probably substitute some things.
