# Take-Aways

* What you measure, you improve
* Some people have never had a good manager
* As you get more senior, your manager expects you to bring them solutions rather than problems
* If you resent your manager, maybe look for another job; if you resent every manager, maybe look within yourself
* The challenge of engineering management is the intersection of engineering and management; it is not pure people management
* The best eng managers come from hands-on roles and derive credibility from that experience
* Good managers care about reports as people, help them navigate difficult situations, want to see them grow and succeed, helps them understand the value of the work and what is expected; feedback is essential
* Happiness at work is the responsibility of the IC; advocate for yourself
* Consider what the unspoken rules and jargon of your org are

# Concepts

* 1-on-1 - build a connection, build trust, have a private communication channel
* Advocate-Manager - sponsoring is better for more senior devs
* Alpha Geek - driven to be the best, valuing technical expertise above all else; typically fragile ego, naive belief in meritocracy, drives a culture of fear; at best they inspire, at worst they attack and lack integrity; may end up in the CTO of a small start-up with an execution-focused VP Eng as a partner
* Benign Neglect - limits the harm done by being absent; just let the devs work
* CTOs - must have great communication, project management, product sense, and technical sense
* Empathy - core skill of a quality manager
* Feedback - praise publicly (with consent!), criticize privately; must be timely; asking for advice is a good way to show respect and trust
* Interns - without a project they are likely to be lost, bored, frustrated; breaking a project up into milestones is necessary to keep work on track; consider having the intern make a presentation about what they accomplished and learned at the end of their project; unlikely to turn into regular hires unless they are graduating soon; where demand for interns is low, it is an opportunity to improve team diversity
* Listening - the first and most basic management skill; pay attention, don't be thinking hard about other stuff; consider listening to understand vs. listening to respond; people are generally not good at clearly saying what they mean
* Mentor-Manager - not the same thing as a buddy, therapist, or coach; better for more junior devs; a good mentor makes time, is available to help; official mentorship programs often become an ambiguous obligation; set specific goals, avoid mentorship as low status emotional labour; consider tracking on-boarding effectiveness, attribute it to mentors; beware assigning mentors around diversity lines
* Promotions - manager should know whether you are ready, should help you navigate the process
* Training - often the manager's responsibility; advocate for the training you want
