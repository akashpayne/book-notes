# Thoughts

Feels like a business audience book padded with exercises and examples, even though it strives to be broadly applicable (personal and professional life.) Common themes include effective listening, acknowleding others, rationality, and self-awareness.

# Take-Aways

* Behaviours considered toxic are generally noisy: ambiguous, contradictory, and/or redundant. Constructive behaviours ask questions and demonstrate that information is being heard.
* Core communication problem could be emotional repsonses to a topic or parties involved, but the fastest way forward is to address behaviour.
* Reading a book alone doesn't change behaviour, training and conscious action is required: awareness, action, and practice.
* Beware of the trap of recognizing a problem without a plan to act on solving it.
* There is a risk of reverting to old habits in times of stress.
* Self-directed "yes-but" can lead to procrastination, cycle of rationalization.
* People often project their hopes and fears onto the others; ambiguous situations leave an opening for that.
* Resolve ambiguity by paraphrasing your understanding of a situation and asking for a yes-or-no acknowledgement; if there is disagreement, open the discussion up with broad questions, try to figure out where misunderstandings lie.
* Make a conscious effort to challenge your assumptions; consider digging into what you believe and asking whether each belief is backed by evidence or supposition.
* Acknowledge and accept uncertainty, make fall-back plans where able. Coach teams to focus on rational concerns.
* Passive gripes elicit reactions that are not constructive: joining in, being argumentative, or offering unwanted advice; the person griping is not actually seeking advice, only support. Acknowledge their feelings, ask them in an open-ended way what they want, clarify the problem; don't offer advice unless asked, your role may not be to coach or provide therapy.
* Beware hostile opinions framed as "feelings;" just adding "I feel that" before an opinion does not make it valid. Eg. "feeling ignored" or "feeling criticized" can be attacks directed against another person.

# Concepts

* Attack / Blame - common responses to attacks are often ineffective: dismissing the situation, proposing a solution, self-defense, self-criticism (leaning into the attack); acknowledge anger to manage it, take time and space to cool down
* Complaint / Gripe Cycle - repetitive, self-perpetuating cycle of unproductive, passive complaints; can be contagious and lower morale
* Leading Question - combine an opinion and a question, discourage honest answers; can mask conflicts and leave them unresolved
* Mind Read / Clarivoyant Readings - mistakes assumption about the intentions of others for facts; caused by failure to recognize ambiguous situations (vague behaviour, silence, neutral response); imaginary conversations are a warning sign
* Mirroring - strategy for defusing attacks; acknowledge and diffuse the anger, repeat the attacks as statements in a less angry (but still angry) tone; mirroring is not agreement, just acknowledgement; as the situation de-escalates, transition from mirroring (repetition) to reflecting (paraphrasing) to resolution (problem solving)
* Negative Prediction / Catastrophe Forecast - dysfunction occurs where a team spends energy bracing for the disaster that will happen rather than planning for challenges that could happen
* Neuroplasticity - ability for the brain to retrain behaviour
* SAVI - System for Analyzing Verbal Interaction, created in 1965 by Anita Simon, Yvonne Agazarian
* Yes-But / Polite Fights - superficial agreement followed by counter-argument; provocative and polarizinge; causes parties to talk past each other, shallow debate that goes nowhere; intervention strategy - motivate, invite, redirect
