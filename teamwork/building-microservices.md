# Thoughts

Building Microservices is a fantastic book and one of the best I've read. It provides a concise summary of the state of tech thought in 2015 in the form of good general advice liberally sprinkled with helpful, concrete references to important resources. Implementation details (the sort that would quickly go out of date) are not provided. Martin Fowler is heavily referenced. An atypically large number of concepts and techs are introduced for such a short book.

# Take-Aways

* Microservices are an approach to SOA
* Strategic Goals -> Principles -> Practices
* Divide Complexity -> Standardize Interactions -> Add Discoverability
* Microservices is another generation of "small is beautiful"
* Monolith for proof of concept, decompose into services
* "Small" = Rewrite and redeploy in 2 weeks (Jon Eaves)
* Standardize system health metrics as much as possible
* Architectural Safety Measures: Timeouts, Bulkheads, Circuit Breakers
* Trade-off exists between MTBF and MTTR
* Warm replica for scaling reads, shards for scaling writes
* Combination of predictive (scheduled) and reactive autoscaling works well
* Conway's Law can apply in reverse - architecture drives org structure
* VLAN is good for security isolation
* Software load balancer (easy config) can sit behind hardware load balancer

# Concepts

* [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
* Adhesive Services - optimized for lock-in; not cohesive

* Blue/Green Deployment
* Canary Release
* CAP Theorem
* Class-Responsibility-Collaboration model
* Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
* Consumer-Driven Contract
* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Control Objective for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT)
* Conway's Law
* Cross-Functional Requirements
* Data Pump Service
* Event Sourcing
* Evolutionary Architecture
* Exemplars - projects that demo good practices
* Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
* Hexagonal Architecture (Alistair Cockburn)
* HTTP Cache-Control, ETags, Expires header
* Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)
* Hypertext Application Langauge (HAL)
* Idempotent Request - eg. request ID
* Immutable Server
* Internal Open Source
* Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
* Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Linux Containers (LXC)
* Loose Coupling, High Cohesion
* Loosely vs Tightly Coupled Orgs - Bazaar vs Cathedral
* Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) vs Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
* Message Hospital / Dead Letter Queue - isolate events that have failed once
* Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle
* Orchestration (central management) vs Choreography (distributed control)
* OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
* Postel's Law / Robustness Principle
* REST API over HTTP
* Semantic Versioning
* Service Level Agreement (SLA)
* Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
* Sidecar Services
* Single Responsibility Principle (Bob Martin)
* SRV Record
* Storage Area Network (SAN)
* Strangler Application Pattern
* Stub Service - mock service for test environment
* Synthetic Transaction Monitoring
* Tailored Service Templates
* Two-Phase Commit
* Type 1 vs Type 2 Virtualization
* UI Fragment Composition
* Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI)

## Anti-Patterns

* Anemic CRUD Service - thin datastore wrapper
* Configuration Drift - server config differs from repo
* Database Integration - services talk via DB
* Deferring performance testing until last step before deployment
* Integration Spaghetti - coupling to vendor solution
* Monolithic Gateway Service - all access through one API
* Onion Architecture - many vertical layers, hard to cut
* Overly fine-grained roles - eg. role for each resource
* PaaS trying to be too smart - their heuristic may fail for your app
* RPC disguised as local call
* Separate reporting for business metrics and system metrics
* Single Sign-on (SSO) Gateway as a single point of failure
