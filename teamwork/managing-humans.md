# Take-Aways

* as a manager, listen, see people, get to know them, make connections at all levels
* the "what do you do" disconnect between managers and employees erodes trust
* "better" is the enemy of "done"

# Concepts

* Coast and Die - you've shipped 1.0, what's next?
* Covert Job - may seem cozy to fly under the radar, but when nobody knows the value you add then your job may be suddenly terminated
* Delegation - how much action per decision? pure delegators are irrelevant; take action to make things happen
* Evil Managers - are rare, but do exist
* Fair-weather Leader - visible when things are going well, turn toxic during hard times; don't do that, instead step up when the going get tough
* Faker Manager - a tech manager in spite of failing at tech; manage upward by teaching them the value of what you do
* Layoffs - you are not truly a manager until you've participated in a multi-month layoff effort
* Managementese - does your manager speak it?
* One-on-One Meetings - be consistent in scheduling, do not skip; always learn something
* Political Food Chain - players, pawns, and free electrons; politically active managers are informed, but it is a thin line between knowing the politics and being a political slimeball; sucks to live in the shadow of a non-factor, your manager's success is your success
* Pride vs Panic - how does your manager handle having a swollen head? how does he handle pressure? panic shows you who a person really is
* Stable Dev - values good process, predictability, teamwork, mitigating risk; often was a jr. volatile who earned battle scars; fear of failure creates conflict with volatiles; may blame "forces beyond our control" for failure
* Volatile Dev - values disruption, rejection of authority, building things fast; often frustrated with stables, refuses to accept failure
