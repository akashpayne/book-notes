# Thoughts

Insightful thought experiment in contrasting tech org culture trends, eg. Google's bias toward Ruinous Empathy vs. Apple's bias toward Obnoxious Aggression.

# Take-Aways

* Telling people what to do doesn't work; the team needs to accomplish things that no one person could do on their own
* Strong relationships underscore good management; build trust with each person who reports to you; Strong relationships enable being direct, frank, candid; relationships do not scale but culture does
* Common mistake to start with Ruinous Empathy with the intent to move into Radical Candor later; this fails to build trust, people don't know where they stand and are afraid to criticize
* Operationalize guidance; to keep winning, criticize the win; don't let a positive result prevent corrective action, but acknowledge the positive; don't sandwich bad news between insincere good stuff, be real
* Praise is more difficult than criticism; needs to be genuine, smart, and personalized; flimsy or inaccurate praise sows doubt; insufficient praise is unacceptable
* Criticism is directed at a person's work (the outcomes) rather than the person themselves; must include justification and a plan to improve; a strong relationship is needed to criticize the work while maintaining trust in the person
* Toxic management (motivation by humiliation) is common, but "soft management" where managers want to be liked is worse; people would rather work with a competent asshole than a nice incompetent, but there is a false dichotomy--it is not a trade-off; tolerating incompetence destroys motivation;w hen obnoxiously aggressive, course correct for caring more rather than compromising honesty and sliding into manipulative insincerity
* Push decisions out to the teams where people are closest to the facts; seek facts, not recommendations; get facts at the source, not second-hand
* Boss role is not to prevent friction but to keep it constructive
* "boss" evokes injustice, "management" sound bureaucratic (petty executors), "leader" sounds self-aggrandizing (BSers who don't do any real work)
* Boss's job is to make people feel productive and connected to their labour; "keep it professional" denies our humanity; we shouldn't repress ourselves to earn a living
* Toxic feelings of superiority - instead of kicking ass, people want to kick your ass; being a boss is a job, not a value judgement
* Boss absorbs the blows; people may never repay you but they are likely to pay it forward; if nobody on your team is mad, you probably aren't pushing them enough; if we have the data, use the data, but if all we have are opinions, let's use yours
* Candor is culturally relative; level of directness in Tokyo is much lower than in Israel, had to substitute "radical candor" for "polite persistence"; British education stresses oral argument, they can be more candid than even New Yorkers
* Really know your team, what motivates them, their goals; a bad boss can stifle somebody on a steep career trajectory; be a partner, not an absentee manager nor a micro-manager
* Avoid only giving attention to struggling team members; time spent with high performers pays dividends for the whole team
* Firing low performers is critical but one of the hardest things; first give humble, direct, candid advice and an opportunity to improve; seek a second opinion, be careful and considerate
* Common lies managers tell themselves about low performers: it will get better (can you specify how?), somebody is better than nobody (low performers often create as much work as they do), a transfer is better than firing (sets other team up for failure), firing will hurt morale (having a low performer is typically worse); high trajectory, low growth team members are often just in a bad fit role
* Consider separating decision meetings from debate meetings; have a debate with the intent to defer the actual decision to a later time
* Persuasion is necessary, even with a clear chain of command; people do a worse job when they don't grok why they're doing the work; authoritarians often neglect persuasion; emotional manipulation gets quick wins, but rationale is needed for persuasion to stick
* Credibility requires demonstrated expertise and humility
* Managers face pressure to be consistent, hampers learning

# Concepts

* 20 Percent Time - Google policy of allowing employees one workday per week for self-directed projects; many employees elect not to take it
* Apple University Mandate - defy the gravitational pull of organizational mediocrity
* Apple's Culture - boss role is listening, seeking, debating, and pushing for decisions, not directing or deciding
* Blue Sky - Apple idea; people pitch project ideas, if approved they get two weeks of work time to try it
* Bring Your Whole Self to Work - show vulnerability, create a safe space, really know people
* Candor - judged by the listener, not the speaker; only works when good faith is understood; challenge, not attack; clear, direct, not mean
* Care Personally - prerequisite of Radical Candor, must be personally invested
* Challenge Directly - prerequisite of Radical Candor, must be direct and unambiguous, even when the news is bad; challenge people, make tough decisions
* Clarify - new ideas are fragile, push for clarity to strengthen them; debating an unclear idea is likely to kill it
* Collaboration Tax - the cost of coordination; as the boss, you spend a lot of time on this
* Cruel Empathy - understanding how people feel and using it against them
* Culture of Listening - management hears people; use a suggestion box, fix some problems promptly and offer clear reasons why others aren't being fixed, time box the effort spent; encourage the team to assign up to three action items to the boss per week; explicitly reject ideas, don't go silent
* Cycle of Relationships and Responsibilities - virtuous cycle of trust and success, vicious cycle of doubt and failure; relationships underlie responsibilities, which underlie culture
* Debate - like a rock tumbler, takes strengthened ideas and polishes them; egos are an obstacle
* Ego - a debate-killer, discourage idea ownership; one trick is to warn people that they may be asked to swap roles in a debate, have them argue the other side
* Emotional Babysitter - it's called management and it's your job; boss role comes with emotional labour
* Front-Stabbing - attacking people directly; a behaviour, not a personality trait; speaking truth to power may devolve into this
* Garbage-Can Decision Making - when decisions are made by the people who happen to be at the table, rather than by the people with the best information
* Get Stuff Done (GSD) Wheel - cycle of Learn, Listen, Clarify, Debate, Decide, Persuade, Execute; don't just diving in and make changes; skipping steps and being stuck wastes time
* Google's Culture - over-valued rapid career growth trajectory; happy medium is needed
* Growth vs Potential - employees who are happy doing good work without advancement must be valued; Plutarch laid bricks, Spinoza ground lenses; there are no "low potential" human beings; shift your mentality from "talent management" to "growth management," describe job skills in terms of ability percentile and growth trajectory; make performance ratings and compensation fair to stability employees, recognize gurus
* Guru - venerable team member, may be stability type
* Kick-Down, Kiss-Up - there is a special place in hell for people who do this
* Loud Listening - Steve Jobs technique; put controversial ideas on the table, demand a reaction
* Manager Feedback Sessions - reports have a chance to review their managers
* Managing at Apple - course designed by Kim Scott; advocated focusing on ambitious team members, later had to recognize that stable team members are also highly valuable
* Managing at Twitter - another course designed by Kim Scott
* Manipulative Insincerity - failure mode, when you neither Care Personally nor Challenge Directly; pushes emotional buttons for short-term gain, easily seen through; only wants to be liked, not mission-driven
* Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
* Obligation to Dissent - policy at McKinsey; unanimous consensus is a red flag, somebody has to raise an objection in order for the idea to be robust
* Obnoxious Aggression - failure mode, when you Challenge Directly but fail to Care Personally; typically most desirable of the failure modes, at least people know where they stand; assholes are tolerated because at least they're honest, but they should take the time to grow their humanity
* Performance - measured over a time span, ot a permanent label; there are no "good performers," only people who performed well recently
* Performance-Potential Matrix - talent acquisition decision tool, created by McKinsey & Co for General Electric; dysfunctional when it only measures management potential; lack of interest in management is not lack of growth
* Plussing - Pixar idea; when pointing out a problem, the speaker must also suggest solutions
* Quiet Listening - Tim Cook technique; spend ten minutes in neutral, silent listening, hear the things that you don't want to
* Radical Candor - combination of Care Personally and Challenge Directly; "radical" because we are trained to avoid speaking frankly; not a personality type, rather a way to gauge criticism; nobody is always successful at Radical Candor
* Rock Star Developers - exceptional results, slow growth trajectory; like the Rock of Gibraltar
* Rockstar Developers - fast growth trajectory; gunning for promotions comes as the expense of team stability
* Ruinous Empathy - failure mode, when you Care Personally but fail to Challenge Directly; Russian anecdote: guy has to amputate his dog's tail, but feels so bad about it that he amputates an inch each day instead of all at once
* Schumpeterian - reference to Joseph Schumpeter, Austrian economist; believed in entrepreneurs as a creative destructive force
* Shashlyk - grilled meat
* Soccer Team of Seven Year-Olds - nobody has a clear role, each player chases the ball in a blind pack
* Spelunking - dive into the details for a small decision from time-to-time, to get a sense of what's really going on; nothing is "above" or "below" anyone's concern
* Three Responsibilities of a Boss - Guidance (feedback, praise & criticism, for the manager too), Team-Building (team composition, motivation), Results (measure outcomes)
* Toyota's Big Red Square - forcefully soliciting criticism; employees stand in the square at the end of their first week and are not allowed to leave until they've come up with three criticisms of the process
* Tweeps - people who work at Twitter
* Up or Out Policy - firing people who stay in the same position for too long, labels stable team members as "B Players" or "capped out"; was a policy at Google, being in the same role for too long was a badge of shame
* US Air Force versus German Luftwaffe - the US routinely sent aces home from combat to train recruits, the Germans typically flew aces until they were shot down; the result over time was the gradual superiority of US pilots
