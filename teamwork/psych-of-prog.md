# Thoughts

Fantastic read, rich in ideas, full of truth. It is incredible how little has changed in 50+ years.

Note that not all bibliography books are included here. There are lots of citations in the book.

# Take-Aways

* All laws have limits; the limits are typically more important to know than the laws themselves
* Discussions may failure to distinguish between professional and hobby programming
* Programming has a mystique, often not well understood; some programmers encourage this, so execs seek to mitigate the human factors
* Decades long efforts to eliminate programmers from the software business have failed; typically such schemes are invented by programmers
* Once people have a new perspective, they will implement improvements on their own
* "Many college-trained developers approach a project like a one-semester class assignment. They think about it or ignore it for a while, then suddenly start jamming on the keyboard to produce something that will earn a passing grade. Software projects done at universities generally don’t have to be maintainable, usable, or testable by another person."
* These days the goal tends to be value delivered to a customer rather than program efficiency; runtime is typically cheap
* "There probably is, in almost every program, some code which actually does the work that was specified" / "even if we succeed in extracting this kernel of the program, we must not be misled into the illusion that we could have started with this kernel as a specification" / "in most cases, we do not know what we want to do until we have taken a flying leap at programming it" / "writing a program is a process of learning"
* The code that is most frequently read is typically problematic code (a bug may have lead the reader there); if a coder doesn't know what good code looks like, they may fail to lean good practices from reading code; the good get better, the bad get worse
* "When a patient recovers, it is the work of the doctor; when a patient dies, it is an act of God. But when a computer program doesn’t work, everyone knows—and everyone knows who is to blame."
* "more than twenty-five years ago I conducted a survey of the women programmers in my advanced software development class. When I asked these students about their experiences working on teams with other women, none of them could answer—because none had ever worked on a team with another woman programmer. Forty years ago, our typical PSL class might have as many as four women out of twenty-four participants; more likely to be eight-to-twelve out of twenty-four."
* "the professional is very tired and a bit irritated by the unending stream of amateurs waving their printouts in her face and condemning the machine, the operator, the system, the keypuncher, the language, or the government. The amateur, on the other hand, can see that the professional does not even care that his means and standard deviations are not going to be ready in time for inclusion in the proceedings of the conference"
* adjust your level of rigor to the task at hand; neither under nor over engineer

## On Programmers

* "A programmer who truly sees his program as an extension of his own ego is not going to be trying to find all the errors in that program."
* a large portion of the variance in software quality delivery can be attributed to differences between programmers in understanding what work is being asked for
* software design, implementation, testing, documentation, and management all require different talents, yet there is a tendency to see "coding skill" as a singular, all-important talent; sometimes these stages are planned to happen in order even though in practice they do not
* developer mindset and environment varies day-to-day; having a variety of types of work (coding, documentation, testing) allows devs to stay productive; forcing types of work into phases interferes
* programmers sometimes quit immediately after getting a raise; the increase in compensation may be perceived as extra pressure to perform well, or may be perceived as being granted in lieu of something the dev really wants
* "If a programmer is indispensable, get rid of him as quickly as possible."
* "The same talents or personality that make a person an excellent amateur programmer may make him singularly unsuited for being a professional one; but the lack of ability to adjust his working behavior to the problem at hand will always make him unsuited."
* when devs encounter a problem with an approach, efficiency-focused devs tend to stick with the current approach and fix the problem, whereas devs focused on fast delivery tend to substitute another approach thus sacrificing program efficiency; the efficiency-focused team may stick with a doomed approach much longer than "get it working now" teams

## On Managers

* "Basic principle of the psychology of management: Managers who pay attention to people get good results"
* Bad managers ask for everything; "It’s as if they think all you have to do to manage the New York Yankees is tell every batter to hit a home run, and every pitcher to strike the batter out."
* managers who demand efficient programs often balk at the cost of changes; managers who demand adaptable programs often accept some sacrifice in performance
* "Nobody can seriously have believed that executives could read programs. Why should they? Even programmers do not read programs."
* managers often attribute group performance to an individual genius rather than being a property of the group; managers often see the team as a brittle structure that will fail if a key member is removed, rather than as a continuum that should outlive its members; this perceived brittleness is often a self-fulfilling prophecy
* managerial psychology often puts social status ahead of productivity
* managers press hard for promises but what they really want are results
* managers may be selected for their willingness to make promises to upper management and may be promoted before it becomes clear that those promises will not be met
* managers are often caught by surprise when a team's performance suffers after losing a team member that was perceived to be unproductive
* "Whenever a supervisor is responsible for work he does not understand, he begins to reward workers not for work, but for the appearance of work." / "Programmers who are observed talking to others are not considered to be working, because the manager has an image that programming work involves the solitary thinker scratching out secret messages to the computer."
* "there is a certain type of leading which is only a crystallization of deep-seated desires many onto the personality of one. In programming, this is scarcely the type of leadership needed"
* it is crucial that leadership be allowed to emerge from the expertise relevant to the current situation; democracy allows for this kind of adaptation, but is not realistic on programming teams
* a team leader may make promises based on an assurance that new resources will be provided (additional headcount, better hardware) only to find that those new resources are not delivered
* "the number one mistake I’ve seen in team formation over the years is adding members to a team based on some presumed skill, rather than on compatibility of the new members with the rest of the team members. Skill may be hard to come by, but it’s always easier to buy or train than compatibility."
* when people know they are being measured but do not get to see the data, they tend to experiment by varying their performance to see what reaction they get

## On Teams

* tightly knit teams often leave jobs together not as a conspiracy but because it's in each individual's interest
* "The lack of experience in programming becomes more evident as the size of the system to be produced increases."
* rule of thumb: three programmers are twice as productive as one, three groups of three programmers are only about twice as productive as one group (or four times as productive as one programmer)
* "the worst way to do a programming project is to hire a horde of trainees and put them to work under pressure and without supervision—although this is the most common practice today" ; "More common today is the second worst way to do a programming project: Hire a miscellaneous horde of contractors (who may actually be trainees in disguise) and put them to work under pressure and without supervision. Or with over-supervision."
* some programming tasks are seen as less prestigious than others, drama ensues; egoless attitudes help
* when one member of the group does not share the group goals it is perceived by others and lowers the productivity of all
* group consensus is more readily achieved by enabling the team to set their own goals
* support teams may tend to drift into fascinating but useless projects unless given persistent, focused direction
* people underestimate how varied software development is in terms of problem domain, tools employed, and in skills required; it takes a community

## On Studies

* Past studies focused on programming as an individual activity, not a social activity; devs spend 2/3rd of their time working with others
* study what people do rather than what they think they do; observation tells us what people do, but not what they can do
* historically, studying programmer behaviour was costly because computer systems and the time of computer programmers were both expensive
* knowing what to measure is a problem; a sociologist can use knowledge of their own culture to construct a reasonable questionnaire, but an anthropologist is harder pressed to know what to ask
* "psychology is the psychology of 18-year-old college freshmen" - common population bias in studies
* studies of dev performance often focus on one type of work, eg. analytical work (tracing bugs) or synthetic work (coding), such that there isn't a good overall view of a given dev's ability to contribute to a realistic project; at best you're studying how helpful a dev is at one phase of a project
* social psychologists have often studied group dynamics under situations that only last for days or weeks, whereas programming team situations may last months or years

## On Optimizations

* Software optimizations by relaxing the spec may come at the cost of people time, can easily be a net negative; eg. consider a program that is 20% faster but needs to be re-run 50% of the time
* "We have long since passed the point where the typical installation spends more money on programming than it does on production work. This imbalance is even more striking when all the work improperly classified as “production” is put under the proper heading of “debugging.”"
* Whether it is an efficiency gain to consume more memory to save runtime depends on the execution environment and can vary rapidly over time; dynamic load balancing needs to consider that users may be more sensitive to standard deviation than mean execution time
* Evaluating a compiler by the rate of instructions generated per minute may simply reward compilers that produce verbose object code; source code lines processed per minute is similarly misleading
* Typically a compiler that omits 10% of a language's features can compile code 50% faster; which 10% varies by architecture
* "When the programmer includes something that is intended to overcome some limitation of the machine, he rarely marks it explicitly as such"

# Concepts

* Accidental Complexity - not inherent to the problem being solved; can be mitigated with psychological change
* Agile programming - can be thought of as "egoless teams"
* Amateur Programming (Hobbyists) - unlike professionals, amateurs typically control their own spec, write programs that only they themselves use, and have more control over their dev environment (tools, conventions)
* Austrian Army - in the 19th century, saw success through hierarchical organization, soldiers are seen as interchangeable; this model is still imitated today but often a project team is more like an engine with parts that cooperate than a pyramid structure for ambitious individuals to climb
* Authoritarian Team - work is organized and guarded by the appointed leader; seems warm and friendly, is fragile, team members don't need to get along with each other, just get along with the leader; groups in crisis tend to be more accepting of strong leadership but more impatient with perceived incompetent leadership
* Bit-Picking - when management gets involved in technical implementation details; may come from a desire to be precise and mistaking precision for clarity
* Blame-Analysis - find the person at fault for the problem; motivates people to hide the true cause
* Card File - for securing punch cards, apparently
* Chief Programmers - HD Mills suggested a programming team structured like a surgical team, with a surgeon and specialized assistants; Weinberg warns about this being a potentially dysfunctional model
* Clarity / Readability - not just maintainability, also how well ideas are transmitted; limitations affecting clarity include hardware limits (memory, performance), language / tooling (work-arounds, boilerplate), programmer limits (mastery of the dev environment, misunderstandings), historical accidents, essential complexity; often these are past limitations, the code would have been written differently today and that may drive jr devs to resent sr staff
* Code Ownership - tends to make the bus factor worse
* Cognitive Dissonance - when acting against one's self-interest, something has to yield but it is unlikely to be the person's self-image; programmers tend to be bad at testing their own work; when code is found to be defective, a programmer with a strong sense of ownership over it may feel attacked; somebody who has just bought a Ford will pay more attention to Ford ads than Chevy ads
* Community - high functioning tech orgs operate as a community
* Conway's Law - would make sense to plan the ideal program structure and assemble the right team to build it, but typically teams are stuck with available dev resources, so the program design follows from the team composition instead
* Correctness - above all other concerns, code needs to solve the problem; efficient, elegant code doesn't matter if it arrives at the wrong answer
* Crisis - tech provides many situations for team crises to emerge; eg. system outage, bugs, change in specs, management changes
* Deadlines - planning around a deadline and granting an extension results in a longer timeline than if the work had been planned to take longer from the outset; slipped deadlines often start with plans that assume optimal conditions; generally accepted that software projects always run over time, but fallacies underlie this belief
* Democratic Team - organized by group consensus, sets its own goals, shares responsibilities, leadership is fluid, may seem surprisingly cold to outsiders, adaptable; tech teams often like shifts in leadership to allow the expert in the current crisis situation to lead
* Detached - personality trait opposed to compliant or aggressive; often seen as desirable in programmers because it is assumed to be a solitary and creative profession
* Devil's Advocate (Obligation to Dissent) - people are more likely to speak out about a problem if there is an ally in the room; unanimous agreement is often a sign of dishonesty
* Egoless Programming - compliant-detached dev culture; ego is a problem for a programmer, leads to fear, increases variance in delivery time; shops that have this culture tend to regard it as a proprietary secret, devs who are job hopping tend not to be coming from this culture; aggressive management culture tends not to appreciate the value of it; this is the most cited, most understood, and most denied idea in the book
* Essential Complexity - inescapable complexity of the problem domain
* Estimates - when devs are set an explicit project goal (eg. delivery speed, program efficiency) they tend to be more accurate in their estimates of meeting that goal, but they also tend to work toward that goal at the expense of other goals
* Experiment Design - poorly designed experiments may only be testing the measurement instruments themselves, not any phenomena; studies about problem solving often fail to translate to programming because the problems used in studies are simple enough to have a known, best solution
* Factors for the Satisfaction of Working Groups (Team Motivators) - material rewards, challenge, working conditions, status, competence of leadership
* False Consensus - beware a consensus achieved through stifling dissenting opinions
* Fisher's Fundamental Theorem - the better adapted a system is to a given environment, the less adaptable it is to new environments; optimizations often make code less portable, less future proof
* Forced Labor - "forced labor—to the small extent that it does work—can only be made to work with relatively immature programmers who are not aware of other possibilities, or with relatively unskilled programmers who are quite aware that other possibilities are not open to them"
* Formal Organization - the org chart; some put too much stock in it; mistake to think that this is the only important org structure
* Half-Partition - blocks valuable communication but allows distracting noise
* Hawthorne Effect - consider that study subjects change their behaviour merely as a result of being studied; studies at the Hawthorne Works of the Western Electric Company failed to consider that workers under observation increased their productivity out of pride; anthropologists struggle to become invisible to the cultures they visit so that life will continue as normal
* Historical Accidents - hacks to solve problems that have been obscured by time
* Informal Organization - unofficial communication channels; smart management adopts innovations from it, eg. using informal channels can help reduce ticket load
* Leadership - as defined by social scientists, the ability to influence others
* Lifecycle of a Team - recruitment, goal setting, delivery, dissolution or new goals; typically there is a crisis at every step
* Maintenance-Oriented Activity - from social psychology, work done by the team to self-sustain, such as resolving conflicts; task and maintenance activities often have different leaders within the group, stereotypically the maintenance leader is the mother figure, often charismatic (see Task-Oriented Activity)
* Monitor System - automated system operator, runs multiple jobs; before this, group congregation around the machine was more common
* Myer-Briggs Personality Inventory (MBPI)
* N-th Level Manager - a manager of managers, most contact with the work is through other managers; very different role from a manager of programmers
* Parkinson's Law / Parkinsonianism - work expands to fill the time allotted
* Personal Computer - "terminal" terminology became "PC" and then "terminal" again
* PERT Chart - Program Evaluation and Review; developed by the US Navy in 1958, part of Critical Path Method (CPM)
* Plus ça Change - "In 1993, I was asked if I was really writing about conversion of an application from Microsoft PC-DOS to Microsoft Windows™. My interrogator was convinced he had been on the project I described, and that I had substituted the names of old machines to protect the guilty party."
* Predictable Delivery - unpredictable delivery is psychologically upsetting; "it is not the mean length of estimated time that annoys people but, rather, the standard deviation in the actual time taken"; managing for quality involves delivering predictably
* Process Reporting - measuring the time a software project takes in each stage of design, analysis, implementation, debugging; when the work is categorized rigidly, it hides the reality that stages often happen out of order, work bleeds from one stage into the next; manager may believe that things happen in sequence because the reporting structure forces that view on the project
* Property-Oriented Programming - tempting to think that a programmer owns his code in the same sense that a painter owns his art, but consider that paintings are typically made to be admired by others whereas most programmers don't intend for others to read their code; appreciation of art is in the beholder, but programs are interpreted by a computer objectively
* Psychology - the psychology of programmers can be studied in terms of social structure (how individuals relate), material culture (tools), recruitment (how people become programmers), and myths (common beliefs)
* Quality - how to measure? elegance and adaptability cannot be quantified, metrics such as line count, cyclomatic complexity are gameable, performance and adherence to spec cannot be determined merely by reading the code; we try to discuss relative code quality by comparing code listings that solve the same problem
* Reporting vs Measuring - reports are often softened by managers, after several layers of reporting the figures may be so muted that they are no longer representative of anything
* Root-Cause Analysis - introspect on the processes that lead to the problem
* Self Esteem - "I now recognize that the root of many of these problems is low self-esteem. The cure lies in an environment that boosts self-esteem, not one that destroys it."
* Slack - excess capacity to buffer against contingencies
* Social Fixation - fixation of social structures; once tooling and practices are established, momentum tends to keep them in place; egoless programming is difficult to introduce, relatively easy to maintain
* Specs - "When there are multiple users, there are multiple specifications."
* Standards Group - committee to evaluate work progress; there needs to be a separation between the people involved in doing the work and the people involved in evaluating it; the lines of control should not simply be the lines of reporting in reverse
* Status Symbols - matter a lot, even though we might wish otherwise; in tech these include privileged access, newer equipment
* Task-Oriented Activity - from social psychology, work done by the team to meet its goals; stereotypically the task leader is the father figure, external facing leader with technical skill (see Maintenance-Oriented Activity)
* Team Mother - sexist term for the maintenance leader see Maintenance-Oriented Activity
* Virtual Memory - swap on disk

# Techs

* BASIC - lang
* COBOL - lang, promised to make code read-able to non-techies
* FORTRAN - lang, lacks the facility to recognize an end-of-file marker
* Fortran - stands for "formula translation," sounded too good to be true in 1956
* IBM 704 - computer
* IBM 709 - almost compatible with the 704, the I/O is entirely different
* JCL - OS/360 Job Control Language
* JOVIAL - lang derived from ALGOL; "Jules' Own Version of Algol"
* MYSTIC - crap lang, lost to history
* Nim - terminal game
* PL/I - lang, apparently better than Fortran; beware math (floating) versus arithmetic (integer) libs
* Spacewar - terminal game
* Terminals - terminal programming made it less fashionable to read program listings in the whole

# Names Dropped

* ACM Special Interest Group on Personnel Research - loose association studying programming from the perspective of management concerns (ie. hiring and training)
