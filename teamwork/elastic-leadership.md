# Take-Aways

* drive the change you want; it's not enough just to be right; managers get paid to make tough calls and risk losing face; if upper management doesn't buy-in, first try to show results before moving on if necessary
* most teams are stuck in survival mode, a vicious cycle; often perceive a lack of pride and professionalism org-wide
* team lead's first priority is to develop quality people; challenge and train skills; value to the company flows from capable teams
* a fixed idea of leadership ignores the team's current needs, eg. "provide what the team needs and get out of their way" (Servant Management) is not a fits-all solution
* devs fear becoming management because of getting stuck in too many meetings, losing friends, losing technical skills
* fragile ego devs often fail to ask for help; daily stand-ups and time-boxed efforts help to mitigate this
* survival mode can end up being a comfort zone; people accept emergencies and heroics as what they excel at; it is addictive; the warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing what to do when the shit hits the fan perpetuates survival mode
* plotting pinball scores over time; often before a breakthrough (noticeable uptake in scores) there would be a period of lower performance; these often happened because new strategies were being discovered and tried out
* be careful with running conversation scenarios in your head, take time to actually talk to them; have a prompt 1-on-1 when somebody on the team is a problem, but don't waste energy trying to reform people who are not ready to learn
* when a team is in survival mode, the manager needs to be present at least half of the time; extricate yourself from as many meetings as it takes
* resentment is a powerful enemy; share the pain of survival mode with the team, participate in overtime, etc.
* team members having direct contact with stakeholders can be a problem while you're trying to get out of survival mode; all commitments have to filter through the manager; use the kanban board to help stakeholders understand the current priorities
* as a manager, aim to teach commitment language when your team reaches the learning phase; be aware that it will feel awkward at first
* it's useful to repeat back a commitment to verify with the other person that there is a shared understanding; "thank you" is a good way to end a commitment communication

# Concepts

* Broken Window - from Broken Windows Theory; people dogpile on opportunites to misbehave; sloppy code begets more sloppy code, escalates into worse problems
* Bus Factor - the smallest number of people that could be removed from a team or project and cause it to stall or fail; when one person is the bottleneck, the Bus Factor is likely one; failure isn't the only risk, learning and morale also suffer; some people enjoy a power monopoly and are easily threatened; pairing sessions help mitigate bus factor
* Coach / Challenge People - style of leadership that facilitates grown; needs time and patience
* Code Reviews - should be mandatory for all text in source control
* Command and Control - style of leadership often needed in crisis / survival mode; fails to challenge the team
* Commitment Language - factual what and when commitments, a verbal contract; noncommittal language leaves room for failure, eg. "hopefully," "as soon as possible," "will try to"; resist buffer time or deflecting, be direct that external factors cannot be committed to; only commit to things under your control, eg. don't say you will meet with somebody, say that you'll contact them to schedule a meeting, don't say you'll fix a bug, say you'll spend time working on it
* Daily Stand-Up - what did you do yesterday? what are you doing today? is anything stopping you?
* Deliberate Practice - give extra time to apply learnings; expect 2x to 3x more time for tasks
* Facilitation - style of leadership that promotes self-organizing teams; "lock the team in a room, given them a goal, get out of the way"; effective when the team is already capable
* Future Memory - do a pre-post-mortem: "imagine it's six months from now and the project has failed; why did it fail?"
* Homework - self-improvement on the job, eg. "try to say yes at least three times per day"
* Just-in-Time Language Errors - gently prompt people to correct their bad communication habits (eg. noncommittal language) as it happens
* Knowledge Silo - leads to "Not My Job" mentality, worsens the bus factor
* Learning Phase - the team has enough slack time to learn and experiment; drive a virtuous cycle through improving processes
* No Downers Rule - criticism must be constructive, not belly-aching
* Not My Job Award - lulzy; people will do a lot of work to avoid work
* Peak - a time of sudden learning, a break-through
* Personal Integrity - say what you'll do, mean what you say, follow through (do it or raise a flag)
* Pizza Sized Team - aka Two Pizza team; small enough that the team can be fed with two pizzas, likely no more than 7 people
* Plateau - a time of slow learning
* Ravine - a time of reduced performance before a break-through, typically something you're afraid to do; jump in and trust that you will come out the other side better
* Rejection Therapy - get rejected at least once per day
* Self-Organizing Phase - the team runs effectively without oversight, manager is free to experiment
* Servant Management - creates bottlenecks, the lead may become a bottleneck
* Slack Time - creating it hard, puts the manager at risk; to gain buy-in from stakeholders, convince them of how much work currently being done could be avoided with learning
* Spartan Development - using the lightest tools, eg. bash and vim are all you need
* Survival Phase - insufficient time for learning, fire-fighting to resolve crises; mitigate by directing the team and creating slack time
* Team Leader Manifesto - great teams are grown, not hired; grow continuously, challenge, avoid staying comfortable; leadership must be adaptable, participate in human interaction, treat software problems as people problems, create slack time, take risks, embrace experimentation
* Test-Driven Development (TDD) - implementation follows from tests
* Wide Team - distributed team, hard to bring them together in person

# Tech

* ClearCase - IBM source control tool; best to avoid
* Skype - video chat app
* TeamViewer - screen-sharing tech

# Names Dropped

* Eleanor Roosevelt - "Do one thing every day that scares you."
* Eli Lopian - "People don't quit their jobs. They quit their managers."
* Jeremy D. Miller - "There are no experts. There is only us."
* Jeremy Weinberg - "There will always be those managers who want to get paid for the hard parts of management work without doing them."
