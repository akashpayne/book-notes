# Thoughts

One of those books with self-analysis exercises in it. Feels a lot like it's telling me what I already know.

# Take-Aways

* "What" people want is often not the core issue; why do they want what they want? look for deeper motivations
* No one person is truly "in charge," everyone accountable to others; our responsibilities are interdependent
* The problem-solving worldview is limiting; life isn't something to be fixed
* We succeed by helping others succeed; waiting to be told what to do does not work
* People are taught early that somebody else will take care of us; eventually one may realize that authorities cannot be trusted
* People tend to overestimate the power of authority and under-estimate their own power
* Establish a life context in which you are more in charge than you are at work, know your skills and aspirations, focus on what is important to you

# Concepts

* Getting Things Done (GTD) - model, categories: Wants (goals), Reality (situation), People (who is involved), You (own position and resources); identify connections between things to form a "change triangle," people move wants to reality
* Leadership - rallying people away from their immediate problems towards some loftier want; clarifying wants (eg. vision, dreams, ideals, purpose) motivates orgs
* People - who makes a difference?
* Reality - what is really happening?
* Wants - why is that important?
* Work - "Work is a primary way to develop yourself while contributing to the world." Believe that it can and should be a source of happiness; learn what the rules are at your workplace and know your position
* You - how might you help? the challenge starts here

# Publications

* Myst - popular 90s adventure game
