# Thoughts

One of those books with self-analysis exercises in it. Feels a lot like it's telling me what I already know.

# Take-Aways

* No one person is truly "in charge," everyone accountable to others; our responsibilities are interdependent
* The problem-solving worldview is limiting; life isn't something to be fixed
* We need to work with both dreams (idealism) and reality (pragmatism), otherwise our work is either stale or fails to make progress; have our feet on the ground and reach for the stars
* "What" people want is often not the core issue; why do they want what they want? look for deeper motivations; knowing why you want what you want becomes more important when things are tough; some of what people want is impossible but it's important to know; people need to know that you understand their wants and often cannot move forward until they believe that
* We succeed by helping others succeed; waiting to be told what to do does not work
* People are taught early that somebody else will take care of us; eventually one may realize that authorities cannot be trusted
* People tend to overestimate the power of authority and under-estimate their own power
* Establish a life context in which you are more in charge than you are at work, know your skills and aspirations, focus on what is important to you
* Take action because it is important to your life, not just because of the current role that you've been assigned
* People often appreciate being asked what they want, but the variety of responses can be overwhelming; help people to understand what they want, get them to commit to it
* Reinventing the wheel is often necessary to gain understanding and build investment

# Concepts

* Alignment - rather than aligning yourself to an organization, accept the lack of alignment, learn from it
* Avoidance - questionable tactic; sacrifices progress for short-term protection
* Change - happens when people take responsibility for the current reality and move it toward their wants
* Collaboration - good tactic when wants are aligned
* Competition - questionable tactic; consider the long-term consequences, especially if success is not guaranteed
* Getting Things Done (GTD) - model, categories: Wants (goals), Reality (situation), People (who is involved), You (own position and resources); identify connections between things to form a "change triangle," people move wants to reality
* Leadership - rallying people away from their immediate problems towards some loftier want; clarifying wants (eg. vision, dreams, ideals, purpose) motivates orgs
* Moguls - skiing, some of us enjoy the challenge of a bumpy ride
* Negotiation - good tactic when wants are not aligned
* People - who makes a difference?
* Persistence - immediate fulfilment requires immediate action, distant fulfilment requires persistence
* Reality - what is really happening? working together requires discovering a shared understanding, pragmatism; is confusing, people may be intolerant of the views of others; steps to discover shared reality: identify issue (find the pain points), gather information (investigate), understand (clarify), respect / accept (recognize others, acceptance is not agreement), decide / act (the better the understanding, the more effective the plan will be)
* Vision Statement - may be corporate bullshit, can be a useful reference point for individual discussion
* Wants - why is that important? dreams, idealism; may be easier to agree on than reality; be clear about this to focus efforts, build commitment
* Work - "Work is a primary way to develop yourself while contributing to the world." Believe that it can and should be a source of happiness; learn what the rules are at your workplace and know your position
* You - how might you help? the challenge starts here
